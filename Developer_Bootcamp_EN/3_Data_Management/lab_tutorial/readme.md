# Data Asset Management Workshop

With your devices connected, device data starts to accumulate in EnOS™. As it could be quite a challenge to manage the huge amount of IoT data, you can use EnOS™ Enterprise Data Platform service to help you manage data assets, reduce data storage cost, lower the development barrier of stream analytics, and increase data access efficiency.


## Scenario

This tutorial walks you through the steps on how to create stream processing pipelines with a template and operators to calculate the average voltage and health level of the smart battery device.

## Before You Start

- Ensure that you have signed up for an individual account or an enterprise account to access the EnOS Management Console.

- Ensure that your accounts have the full access to the IoT Hub and Enterprise Data Platform services, which is already done by the trainer.

- Read through the [Real-time Data Flow](https://support.envisioniot.com/docs/data-asset/en/2.3.0/learn/data_flow.html) documentation to get an overview of data flows in EnOS.
